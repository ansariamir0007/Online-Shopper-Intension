One of them is to do a research and develop a methodology by building models for Online Consumer Commercial Intent Analysis. In this context, the mouse movements, the link and button click information that the user has on the screen and the tracking data of the pages visited will be obtained and the actions taken as the result of these data will be determined. Acceptable actions will be used as labels during pattern definition with supervised learning algorithms. Thus, when any user receives actions that match the predefined pattern, they will be tagged with the obtained pattern function and the action to be taken instantaneously will be determined. One of the difficulties in developing this model will be choosing the algorithm with the best accuracy and performance, which is appropriate to the pattern recognition algorithms, the data structures obtained from the users and the e-commerce system infrastructure during the implementation of the machine learning procedure. It is likely that the number of positive instances in which data Abandonment actions are taken is less than the number of negative instances representing all other actions. In this case, the results obtained will be evaluated with appropriate metrics instead of the accuracy rate that may lead to false evaluations.
